       "\n",
       "Next, the document talks about the protection offered by this plan. It mentions high personal accident coverage up to S$3 million. This includes protection against Accidental Major Permanent Disablement and Other Permanent Disablements, which are covered under different sections with varying payout amounts.\n",
       "\n",
       "The document also specifies that the coverage gets boosted up to 1.5 times with a Benefit Booster. This applies in cases of injuries from most traffic-related accidents in Singapore or while overseas.\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, the plan offers high medical expenses reimbursement, covering outpatient and hospitalisation expenses up to S$7,500 per accident. The insured can choose their preferred medical treatment and care by a Complementary Medicine Practitioner or Allied Health Professional after an accident.\n",
       "\n",
       "The document also mentions that this insurance plan is suitable for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents (PRs), and holders of Employment Pass who are aged between 17 and 65. Juveniles (aged between 1 to 16) and holders of certain passes may purchase only the Basic Plan under this policy.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's also noted that replacing an existing accident and health plan with a new one, such as this GREAT Protector Active plan, is usually not advisable. A penalty may be imposed for early plan termination, and the new plan might cost more or have fewer benefits at the same cost.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, the document mentions that the information provided is correct as of 1 January 2024 and that in case of discrepancy between the English and Chinese versions, the English version shall prevail.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, putting all this together, the insurance plan is called GREAT Protector Active. It offers high personal accident coverage up to S$3 million, including protection against various types of disabilities and medical expenses. The plan also includes a benefit booster that increases payout amounts in certain cases. Additionally, it provides reimbursement for medical expenses after accidents, allowing the insured to choose their preferred treatment and care providers.\n",
       "\n",
       "The plan is targeted towards individuals who are Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, or holders of an Employment Pass, aged between 17 and 65. It's important to note that this plan may not be suitable for everyone, and replacing an existing policy without consulting a qualified financial advisor could lead to penalties or less favorable terms.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the GREAT Protector Active plan seems to provide comprehensive personal accident coverage with various benefits aimed at safeguarding against unexpected events while allowing the insured to maintain an active lifestyle.\n",
